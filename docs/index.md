AniList is a **desktop app for managing anime you have watched, optimized for use via
a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User
Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, AniList can get your anime management tasks done
faster than traditional GUI apps.

* If you are interested in using AniList, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing AniList, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
